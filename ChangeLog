1.4.4	28 March 2005
	* Create About Dialog using new API.
	* Reconstructed AddZone dialog using GtkTreeModel instead of
	  deprecated CList (zone.c). This fixes up the problem where the
	  size of the scrolled window froze up after the first use (now it
	  is adjusted as each continent or country is selected).
	* Converted deprecated gtk_object_set_data to g_object_set_data (etc)
	  (rendezvous.c).
	* Used GtkComboBox instead of deprecated GtkCombo for the list of
	  months in rendezvous.c
	* At this point, there are no known deprecated GTK functions or
	  objects used.	 Please submit a bug if you find one I missed.
	  The 1.4 series will be complete once automatic resizing of the
	  clock window has been fixed.
	
1.4.3	18 March 2005
	* only use a seconds timer if seconds are in fact used in the display
	  format, otherwise use a minute timer.
	
	
1.4.2   24 February 2005
	* Oops, should have checked other compiler warnings.
	  Added #includes to timer.c and options.c.

1.4.1	24 February 2005
	* Use unsynchroniseFromDone() when using the Done button to leave
	  Rendezvous. This toggles the Rendezvous action (in the menu),
	  ensuring the Rendezvous state is kept consistent.
	* #include <stdlib.h> in rendezvous.c to handle getenv() correctly.

1.4.0	3 January 2005
	* 1.4 is a complete overhaul to modernise the API, removing
	  deprecated function calls.  In the interests of not missing
	  Debian sarge, I will release it pointwise as each part of the
	  revision is complete.	
	* accepted fixes to tzwatch from Debian 1.3-5 (fixes handling of
	date formats containing spaces)
	* New option node doneLabel for rendezvous, under <gworldclock> 
	  in ~/.gworldclock:
	  <rendezvous>
	     <doneLabel>Return></doneLabel>
	  </rendezvous>
	  Implemented since "Done" was not sufficiently clear to some users,
	  as a means of indicating that you are done with Rendezvous and wish
	  to return to the normal clock.
	  Also, change "Update" to "Update View", to make it clearer what
	  the button does.
	* Modernised GTK API:
	      - menus use GTKActions
	      - ToggleAction used for Rendezvous in main menu, allowing it
	      to be switched on and off, with a tick showing it is on.
	* Rendezvous allows a new zone to be rendezvoused against with
	  only a single left-click.
	* Changed gtk_timeout_add to g_timeout_add in timer.c, but it does
	  not seem to make any difference to CPU usage.

1.3	5 December 2003
	* Added facilities to options.c to read and save an options file
	in XML format.
	* Option file nodes: 
	<gworldclock> - root node
	<timeDisplayFormat> - format for display of time and date
	                      (as accepted by "date")
	* Added Preferences dialog box to File menu
	- allows Time and Date display format to be set to one of
	several preset alternatives, or to a user-defined format.

1.2	28 September 2003
	* Use config file (~/.gworldclock) to store user's preferred
	display format for time&date -- work suspended to push I18N patch
	through.
	* Internationalisation patch provided by Junichi Uekawa.
	  Ran "gettextize -c" myself to control incorporation of patch:
		* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add config.rpath.
		* configure.ac (AC_OUTPUT): Add po/Makefile.in,
	* After talking to Jeff Waugh at the Debian 10 Year Celebration in
	Sydney, I decided to rephrase "synchronisation" as "rendezvous",
	to make the intent clearer.

1.1	5 April 2003
	* Split code into separate files.
	* The point of this was to facilitate debugging the problem of the
	flashing bar on the bottom (unpopulated) row of the
	window. However, with GTK+2 bumped up to v2.2, the flashing seems
	to have disappeared, so it must have just been a library bug.
	* Removed lame comment comparing 64bit to 32bit time
	representations in "About" message.
	* Recompiled gworldclock.1 from gworldclock.sgml using docbook2man
	(Debian package docbook-utils).

1.0.3	28 September 2002
	* Rearranged code for handling mouse selection (by left or right
	button) of zones.  Fixes hanging dragged zone on right mouse click.

1.0.2	25 September 2002
	* Closed a gaping memory leak in SetToGivenTime(), and also in
	getMonthIndex().

1.0.1	21 September 2002
	* Update version and date in configure.ac

1.0     21 September 2002
	* Ported to GTK+ 2.0.
	* configure scripts generated with automake 1.6, autoconf 2.53
	* fixed tzwatch to only show timezone (not descriptive label) for
	each zone in .tzlist.
	* size of window is adjusted automatically, including when
	description of zones is changed.	
	* I decided the internationalization and neater fonts afforded by
	GTK+2, not to mention the restructuring into a GTKTreeView object,
	warranted bumping up the major version to 1.0.

0.3.3   20 January 2002
	* Changed "timezone" to the correct English phrase "time zone".

0.3.2	29 September 2001
	* close timezone file after saving timezones
	* ignore "file not found" error when reading timezone file
	* Using "make distclean" rather than "make maintainer-clean"
	  probably makes more sense for distributing the source.

0.3.1	25 August 2001
	* added bin_SCRIPTS and man_MANS to Makefile.am, ran prepnotes
	  to regenerate Makefiles.
	* ran "make maintainer-clean" to clear out config.status in source
	  package (lintian complained about it)

0.3.0   18 July 2001
	* Added tzwatch.1 man page (prepared by Joop Stakenborg while
	tzwatch was included with Debian package twclock).
	Added gworldclock to "See Also" section of tzwatch.1,
	and made other minor clean up to tzwatch.1.
	* Created gworldclock.sgml, a DocBook man page.  Prepared the
	corresponding man page (gworldclock.1) with docbook-to-man.

0.2.1   July 2001
	* Replaced autoconf's symlinks to install-sh, missing and mkinstalldirs
	  with the actual files they were linked to.  They shouldn't have 
	  caused a problem if you compile with ./configure, but were reported 
	  as problematic in Debian bug #105188.
		    

0.2.0	June 2001.
	* implemented time synchronisation, allowing the time to be checked
	  for other than the current time.
	* synchronisation limited to between 1901 and 2038 on 32 bit
	  machines.
	* Put tzwatch into source directory.
	* Added README, COPYRIGHT, GPL files.

	
0.1.0   * reordering of zones in list enabled
	* #include <string.h> to hopefully fix implicit declaration of
strcpy and other string functions (warning generated on 64bit Alpha)
and change that strcpy to strncpy to avoid buffer overflows
	* likewise added #include <stdlib.h> for getenv etc,
	SetTime declared in gworldclock.h
        * -Wall added to Makefile to help find problems (how does this fit
with autoconf?)
	* explicity define rowdata[1] (to NULL), or list reordering
	crashes (can anyone remember what rowdata[1] was for?...)

        [yet to work out how to reorder items in list
	how do we know the order changed? - for saving list on close ]

	
0.0.1  Fixed to read description/TZ for new zone from Entry boxes only
when the zone is actually being added.  Similarly for changing description.

0.0.0  Initial "public" release.  Display and selection of timezones
basically works. First simple deb package prepared.
