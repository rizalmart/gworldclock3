.SH NAME
gworldclock \- Displays time and date in specified time zones.
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBgworldclock\fR [ \fB-f \fIFILE\fB\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBgworldclock\fR displays the time and date of
specified time zones using a GTK+ interface. It also allows the
zones to be "rendezvoused" or "synchronised" to a time other than the current time.
.PP
The time zones may be chosen from the list given in the GUI user
interface.  The zones available are generated from the data in
/usr/share/zoneinfo/zone.tab.  The chosen set of zones is stored
in ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/gworldclock/tzlist.list by default, but an alternate file may be specified
at the command line via -f. Alternatively this file may be
created by hand in TZ format. The zone list is kept in a format
consistent with the shell script tzwatch, currently found in
twclock.  The format consists of one TZ string per line,
optionally followed by a human-friendly string enclosed in
inverted commas ("), providing a name for the zone.
.SH "OPTIONS"
