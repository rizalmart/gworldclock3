gworldclock allows the time in any number of time zones chosen by the user to 
be tracked.  The zones may also be "synchronised" ("rendezvoused") to times 
other than the current time.  Zones are stored in ~/.tzlist.   

tzwatch is a script which displays the time for the different zones to the 
console.  It also uses ~/.tzlist.

Some user preferences may be set in ~/.gworldclock, an XML config
file.  For example:
<gworldclock>
  <timeDisplayFormat>%c</timeDisplayFormat>
  <rendezvous>
      <doneLabel>Return To Normal Clock Operation</doneLabel>
  </rendezvous>
</gworldclock>

timeDisplayFormat indicates how the display of the time in gworldclock
is to be formatted.  It may be set within the program using the menu
item File/Preferences, which will automatically save to
~/.gworldclock.

The <doneLabel> item inside <rendezvous> enables the text of the
"Done" button to be changed (indicating the user wishes to return from
Rendezvous to normal clock operations).  Some users have indicated
that "Done" is not clear to them, so this facility allows them to set
their preferred label.  It can only be set by hand in ~/.gworldclock,
the user interface within the program does not cater for it.


The man page for gworldclock (gworldclock.1) was generated by hand from 
gworldclock.sgml using "docbook2man gworldclock.sgml". 
It has not been put into the Makefile for install purposes.
