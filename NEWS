gworldclock allows the time in any number of time zones chosen by the user to 
be tracked.  The zones may also be "synchronised" to times other than the 
current time.  Zones are stored in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gworldclock/tzlist.list.   

tzwatch is a script which displays the time for the different zones to the 
console.  It also uses $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gworldclock/tzlist.list.

gworldclock was originally developed under GTK+ 1.2, GTK+2, and ported to GTK+3.

It should be sufficient to run ./configure and then make to build gworldclock.
However, if there are problems with configure, it can be regenerated by running
prepnotes, which calls the aclocal, autoconf, automake series of commands.
I haven't fiddled with "make install", since I just install via the debian 
package.

gworldclock.c.no_time_t contains experimental code attempting (unsuccessfully)
to run the clock with only struct tm, without relying on time_t.  This was in 
the hope of evading the 32bit second limitation limiting the clock to between 
1901 and 2038.
